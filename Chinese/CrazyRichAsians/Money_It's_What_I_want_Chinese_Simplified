Oh, Money
(That's what I want)
A lot of money
(That's what I want)
Oh, a lot of money

[Verse 2]
The best things in life are free
But you can give them to the birds and bees
I need money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

Your love gives me such a thrill
But your lovin' don't pay the bills
I give me money
I need money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

[Chorus]
And I want money, money, money, money, oh
(That's what I want)
Money, money, money, money
(That's what I want)
I want some money, money, oh, money
(That's what I want)
I want some money, m-money, money, money
Ohhh
(That's what I want)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
