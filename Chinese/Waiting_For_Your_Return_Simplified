Waiting For Your Return

[Verse 1]
好花不常开 好景不常在
愁堆解笑眉 泪洒相思带
今宵离别后 何日君再来
喝完了这杯 请进点小菜
人生难得几回醉 不欢更何待
(来来来 . . . 喝完了这杯再说吧 ）
今宵离别后 何日君再来
 
[Verse 2]
停唱阳关叠 重擎白玉杯
殷勤频致语 牢牢抚君怀
今宵离别后 何日君再来
喝完了这杯 请进点小菜
人生难得几回醉 几回醉
不欢更何待
今宵离别后 何日君再来

Waiting For Your Return
[Verse 1]
Beautiful flowers aren't always in bloom, good times don't last forever
Sadness gathers to undo the smile in my eyebrows, flowing tears carry my longing
When will you return after we part tonight?
After this drink, please bring in some snacks
How many drunk times can one have in life? When should one indulge if not now?
(Come now... we'll talk after this drink)
When will you return after we part tonight?

[Verse 2]
Stopping the Yangguan song - and raising again the white jade cup
Eagerly making conversation with you and holding on tightly in your embrace
When will you return after we part tonight?
After this drink, please bring in some snacks
How many drunk times can one have in life? How many drunk times?
When should one indulge if not now?
When will you return after we part tonight?
