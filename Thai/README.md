Yes, the Thai language does have a romanized script equivalent, commonly known as Romanization or transliteration. 
This is a way of representing Thai words using the Latin (Roman) alphabet.

There are several systems for Romanizing Thai, including:
	1.	RTGS (Royal Thai General System of Transcription) –
This is the official Romanization system used by the Thai government. It’s used in road signs, passports, and official documents. 
It aims for readability over phonetic accuracy (e.g., it doesn’t indicate tones or vowel length).

Example:
Thai: กรุงเทพฯ (the capital)
RTGS: Krung Thep Maha Nakhon
(English: Bangkok)
	2.	ISO 11940 and ISO 11940-2 –
	•	ISO 11940 provides a strict transliteration, preserving original Thai orthography (with lots of diacritics).
	•	ISO 11940-2 offers a simplified phonetic version that’s more readable but less precise.
	3.	Phonetic Romanization (informal) –
Many people, especially online or in casual settings, use ad-hoc Romanization based on how words sound to English speakers. It varies widely and isn’t standardized.
